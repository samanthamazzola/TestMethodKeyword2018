keyword = params!!

use this so that you don't method overload, and you can take all and pass all values/numbers of an array (double, dec, int, string)
- must call from the Main() method



Method Overloading:
methods with the same name, diff params
can be:
- the number of params is different

- different type of params

- different order of params
